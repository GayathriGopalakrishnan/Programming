/*  Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

Inherits from Book
Has a parameterized constructor taking these 3 parameters:
string title.
string author.
int price.
Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these 3 lines:
Title:, a space, and then the current instance's title.
Author:, a space, and then the current instance's author.
Price:, a space, and then the current instance's price.

Sample Input
The following input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in your editor:
The Alchemist
Paulo Coelho
248

Sample Output
The following output is printed by your display() method:
Title: The Alchemist
Author: Paulo Coelho
Price: 248                     */
